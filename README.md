Ruby Closet
====================
<p>Ruby Closet is a Ruby application that takes a user's closet inventory and picks out an outfit based on type of clothing, style of clothing, and temperature outside.</p>

Purpose

<p>This is part one of my capstone project for the Nashville Software School Software Development Fundamentals Course.</p>
<p>The constraints of the project is that I must use standard library Ruby with the exception of being able to use ActiveRecord as an ORM. The concept of this capstone is to demonstrate the mastery of Ruby itself.</p>

  <li>Provide outfits based on user's style, type of clothing, and outside temperature.</li>
